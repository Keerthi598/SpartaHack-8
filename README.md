Connect volunteers with people in the community who need help

## Description

A lot of times people don't get the help they need which usually results in them either ignoring the problem or just being very inefficient at the job. Both returning soon to remind their poor choice.

Blaming them for this problem DOES NOT make the problem go away. In fact doing so is pretty much doing the very same thing we are complaining about.

So, how about a solution?

And the solution is ..... You post your problem. The people around you reach out with a solution.

It literally can't get easier than that
